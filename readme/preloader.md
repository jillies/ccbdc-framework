Preloaders
======

Preloader can only be used on their own - if the usage is within another component like uploading image, it would be best to fork and test the usage out first.

The preloader is fixed at 60px by 60px.

```HTML
<div class="preloader--container">Loading...</div>
```

Please note that the text within the container will only be seen if the CSS has been stripped.
