More to do for the father that I met who was losing his job and choking back the tears, wondering how he would pay $4,500 a month for the drugs his son needs without the health benefits that he counted on. They stood on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, as the blows of billy clubs rained down.

But it is where we start, and starty is all we can do to this world that we HAVE
The Holy Koran teaches that whoever kills an innocent, it is as if he has killed all mankind; and whoever saves a person, it is as if he has saved all mankind.
But they sense, deep in their bones, that with just a slight change in priorities, we can make sure that every child in America has a decent shot at life, and that the doors of opportunity remain open to all. Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend. So long as our relationship is defined by our differences, we will empower those who sow hatred rather than peace, and who promote conflict rather than the cooperation that can help all of our people achieve justice and prosperity.

Although I believe that the Iraqi people are ultimately better off without the tyranny of Saddam Hussein, I also believe that events in Iraq have reminded America of the need to use diplomacy and build international consensus to resolve our problems whenever possible.
Now even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters, the negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes. But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy. Moreover, freedom in America is indivisible from the freedom to practice one's religion. Today, America has a dual responsibility: to help Iraq forge a better future - and to leave Iraq to Iraqis. And we will do so in partnership with Muslim communities which are also threatened.

This is where we are right now this is where we are right now this is where we are right now
This time we want to reject the cynicism that tells us that these kids can't learn; that those kids who don't look like us are somebody else's problem. More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet. I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan.
It seems to me that each day, thousands of Americans are going about their lives - dropping the kids off at school, driving to work, shopping at the mall, trying to stay on their diets, trying to kick a cigarette habit - and they're coming to the realization that something is missing.
We will all have to make concessions to achieve this We will all have to make concessions to achieve this We will all have to make concessions to achieve this
He is a man who served his country as a U.S. Marine; who has studied and lectured at some of the finest universities and seminaries in the country, and who for over thirty years led a church that serves the community by doing God's work here on Earth - by housing the homeless, ministering to the needy, providing day care services and scholarships and prison ministries, and reaching out to those suffering from HIV/AIDS. Let us be our brother's keeper, Scripture tells us. Not with so much work to be done. They have killed people of different faiths - more than any other, they have killed Muslims.
A belief in things not seen
They stood on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, as the blows of billy clubs rained down. But the truth is, that isn't all that I know of the man. That is why we are forging service projects in America that bring together Christians, Muslims, and Jews.
These are some of the challenges that test our conscience - as Americans and people of faith.
Because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters
Those stories - of survival, and freedom, and hope - became our story, my story; the blood that had spilled was our blood, the tears our tears; until this black church, on this bright day, seemed once more a vessel carrying the story of a people into future generations and into a larger world. What the nay-sayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me.
The fear and anger that it provoked was understandable, but in some cases, it led us to act contrary to our ideals. Since the Islamic Revolution, Iran has played a role in acts of hostage-taking and violence against U.S.
Thank you. And may God's peace be upon you.
