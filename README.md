# CCBDC-framework

This framework is intended to be used for the new Maxis and Hotlink websites - all generic templates and components will be built and reusable in any way.

Here's a guide on how to use a template or component:

##Templates

======

###Header

Navigations are interchangable when required - the ability to use the normal standard navigations, expand panel and dropdowns. You can use these all permutations of these or not at all.

Colours and backgrounds are managed by using a .brand--name div that wraps around the entire HTML

```HTML
<div class="brand--maxis">Your content here</div>
```

The sample of all headers below:
[Full Navigation with an expand (Maxis)](navigation-full.php)
[Navigation with dropdown (Maxis)](navigation-dropdown.php)
[Navigation with an expand (Hotlink)](navigation-hotlink.php)
