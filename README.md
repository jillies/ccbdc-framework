# CCBDC-framework

This framework is intended to be used for the new Maxis and Hotlink websites - all generic templates and components will be built and reusable in any way.

Here's a guide on how to use a template or component:


Templates
======

### Header


Navigations are interchangable when required - the ability to use the normal standard navigations, expand panel and dropdowns. You can use these all permutations of these or not at all.

Colours and backgrounds are managed by using a .brand--name div that wraps around the entire HTML

```HTML
<div class="brand--maxis">Your content here</div>
```

The sample of all headers below:

[Navigation with an expand (Maxis)](navigation-full.php)

[Navigation with dropdown (Maxis)](navigation-dropdown.php)

[Navigation with an expand (Hotlink)](navigation-hotlink.php)


### Footer


There are two types of footers, one to be used fully on a marketing standpoint, the other thin one for functional purposes. In terms of code, the thin footer is derived from the normal one and can use the exact same code, just less.

View the samples below:

[Normal footer (Maxis)](navigation-full.php)

[Thin footer (Maxis)](navigation-dropdown.php)

[Normal footer (Hotlink)](navigation-hotlink.php)

[Thin footer (Hotlink)](navigation-thin-hotlink.php)
